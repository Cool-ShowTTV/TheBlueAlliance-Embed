# Not done yet, but should work please leave any feedback in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/Cool-showTTV/TheBlueAlliance-Embed/discussions)

## How to use
Embed this link in an IFrame and replace "teamNum" with the team number you want<br>
```https://thebluealliance-embed.herokuapp.com/?num=teamNum```<br>
If you want to embed into your GitHub's organizations do this and replace "teamNum" with the team number you want<br>
```![events](https://thebluealliance-embed.herokuapp.com/?num=teamNum)```<br>

## Example
If you want an example of what it looks like here is The Juggernauts' embeded in GitHub.<br>

## Future Ideas:
- [ ] Have a JS that can be added to auto put B.A. events for teams.
- [ ] Custom colors
