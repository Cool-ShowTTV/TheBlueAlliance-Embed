# Not done yet, but should work please leave any feedback in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/Cool-showTTV/TheBlueAlliance-Embed/discussions)

## How to use
Embed this link in an IFrame and replace "teamNum" with the team number you want<br>
```https://thebluealliance-embed.herokuapp.com/?num=teamNum```

## Example
If you want an example of what it looks like here is The Juggernauts' ones from the time of writing.<br>
I am going to add styling to it to make it easier to read on diffrent colors or add a way for anyone to give any hex for the text.

## Future Ideas:
- [ ] Have a JS that can be added to auto put B.A. events for teams.
